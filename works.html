        <h2>Our Works</h2>
        <p>In 2024, the English Society undertook a meaningful book donation drive, encouraging students to contribute old books to support education. This event not only helped promote the spirit of giving but also aimed to make a tangible impact on the educational resources available to others.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, the society organized two impactful seminars in 2024. One seminar focused on offering students insights into higher education opportunities abroad, in collaboration with esteemed foreign universities. The other, in partnership with USEF Nepal, provided valuable guidance on academic and professional development, opening doors to further growth and learning.
            <br><br>
            Building on this momentum, in 2025, the society hosted a thought-provoking speech competition titled "The Power of Words." This event gave students the opportunity to showcase their public speaking skills and explore the immense influence that words can have in shaping perceptions, inspiring action, and bringing about change. Through these diverse initiatives, the English Society has demonstrated its commitment to fostering academic excellence, nurturing communication skills, and making a positive impact on both the student body and the broader community.</p>
